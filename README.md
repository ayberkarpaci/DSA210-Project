# DSA210-Project
Investigating the Effects of Coffee Consumption and Twitter Usage on Focus &amp; Productivity

## Project Overview
In today's fast-paced digital world, caffeine and social media have become two dominant forces shaping daily routines. Over the next three months, I will systematically track my coffee consumption and Twitter usage to evaluate their effects on my focus and productivity.

The goal is to uncover patterns in my behavior and determine whether these habits are enhancing or hindering my ability to concentrate. Using statistical analysis and data visualization, I will explore correlations between caffeine intake, social media engagement, and work efficiency. The ultimate objective is to make data-driven adjustments to my daily routine and optimize my mental performance.

## Objectives
1. **Identify Productivity Influencers**

   Examine how different levels of coffee consumption and varying durations of Twitter usage impact focus and work efficiency.

3. **Optimize Daily Habits**

    Determine the ideal balance between caffeine intake, social media use, and productivity.
   
5. **Leverage Data Science Techniques**

    Apply statistical methods and visualization tools to extract meaningful insights from personal behavioral data.

7. **Improve Self-Awareness**

    Gain a deeper understanding of how small daily choices affect cognitive performance and workflow.

## Motivation
This project is fueled by both curiosity and practical necessity. As someone who drinks coffee regularly and spends significant time on Twitter, I want to assess whether these habits contribute to or detract from my ability to focus.

### Why This Matters?

#### 🔹 Data Over Assumptions 
  Instead of relying on intuition, I want clear, measurable evidence to determine the real impact of caffeine and social media on my work habits.

#### 🔹 Personal & Professional Growth 
  By understanding my behavioral patterns, I can create an optimized daily structure that enhances focus, efficiency, and overall well-being.

#### 🔹 A Scientific Approach to Productivity 
  This project is an opportunity to apply data science in a real-world context, transforming subjective experiences into objective insights.

## Dataset
For three months, I will collect daily records of various factors that may influence productivity. Key variables include:

### Coffee Consumption ☕

#### ➖Number of cups consumed
#### ➖Time of consumption (morning, afternoon, evening)

### Twitter Usage 📱

#### ➖Total time spent on Twitter (minutes)
#### ➖Number of sessions and peak usage hours

### Productivity Metrics 📊

#### ➖Hours spent on focused work
#### ➖Self-rated concentration level (scale of 1-10)
#### ➖Number of tasks completed

### External Factors 🌙

#### ➖Sleep duration & quality
#### ➖Stress levels (self-reported)
#### ➖Exercise & physical activity
#### ➖All data will be logged manually using Google Sheets/Excel for structured collection, ensuring consistency.

## Tools and Technologies
To process, analyze, and visualize the collected data, I will use:

📌 Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation

📌 Matplotlib & Seaborn – Graphical analysis and data visualization

📌 SciPy & Statsmodels – Statistical testing and regression modeling

📌 Jupyter Notebook – Organizing analysis and documentation

📌 Google Sheets/Excel – Manual data logging and tracking

## Analysis Plan
The project will be broken down into the following phases:

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
Track daily habits and log them consistently.
Handle missing values and standardize time-based entries.
### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate visualizations to observe trends (scatter plots, time-series analysis).
Compute correlation matrices to identify key relationships.
### 3️⃣ Statistical Testing & Hypothesis Analysis
Test whether higher caffeine consumption correlates with increased productivity.
Examine if excessive Twitter usage negatively affects focus and efficiency.
### 4️⃣ Trend Analysis & Predictive Insights
Identify patterns over time (e.g., does coffee boost focus in the short term but reduce efficiency later?).
Evaluate how productivity fluctuates based on external factors (e.g., poor sleep, stress levels).
### 5️⃣ Optimization & Actionable Recommendations
Use findings to create a personalized efficiency strategy.
Develop guidelines on the best times to consume caffeine and limit social media usage.

## Conclusion
At the end of this project, I aim to answer:

#### ✔ Does coffee improve focus, or is the effect overrated?
#### ✔ How does Twitter usage influence cognitive performance and productivity?
#### ✔ Is there an optimal caffeine-social media balance for maximizing efficiency?
#### ✔ What small changes can I implement to enhance my daily workflow?

Rather than relying on conventional wisdom, this project will provide a data-driven approach to understanding my daily habits. The insights gained can be applied beyond just coffee and Twitter—potentially shaping better time management, work routines, and focus strategies for long-term success.

#### 🚀 By leveraging data science in a personal experiment, I hope to uncover practical ways to improve productivity while maintaining an enjoyable lifestyle.
